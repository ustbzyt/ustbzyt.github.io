  <h1>如何延缓人体的衰老？</h1>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Delaying human aging is an intricate challenge that requires a combination of pharmacological, nutritional, lifestyle, and regenerative strategies to extend healthspan and potentially lifespan. Recent clinical trials and experimental studies have demonstrated that interventions ranging from selective senolytic drugs and metabolic modulators to dietary modifications and exercise protocols can mitigate the deleterious effects of aging at molecular, cellular, and systemic levels (Clinical Trial Search: anti-aging OR longevity OR 延缓衰老 OR healthy aging OR 延迟人体衰老). This report outlines the current state of research, with emphasis on mechanistic insights and translational clinical evidence that supports interventions from multiple domains.
  </p>

  <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Aging is characterized by the progressive decline of physiological functions and the onset of numerous age-associated diseases including cardiovascular disorders, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and cancer, all of which significantly impact quality of life (li2021agingandage‐related pages 1-3). The complexity of aging arises from cumulative molecular damage, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, telomere attrition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular senescence (li2021agingandage‐related pages 3-4). In the context of extending human longevity, multiple strategies have been studied, ranging from pharmaceutical interventions and regenerative medicine to nutritional strategies, physical exercise, and lifestyle modifications (Clinical Trial Search: anti-aging OR longevity OR 延缓衰老 OR healthy aging OR 延迟人体衰老). This report provides an in‐depth review of the rapidly expanding body of research on anti-aging interventions, drawing on clinical trial evidence and preclinical investigations.
  </p>

  <h2>II. Pharmaceutical Interventions and Clinical Trial Evidence</h2>
  <h3>A. Metabolic Modulators and mTOR Inhibition</h3>
  <p>
    Pharmacological agents targeting nutrient sensing and metabolic pathways have emerged as promising candidates in delaying aging. Rapamycin, a well‐studied mTOR inhibitor, has shown efficacy in extending lifespan in animal models through improvement of immune function, reduction in inflammation, and modulation of senescence‐associated secretory phenotypes (li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 16-18). The clinical trial NCT04488601 investigated the safety and efficacy of intermittent rapamycin dosing in older adults, with endpoints that included physiological and biochemical markers related to aging (NCT04488601). In addition to rapamycin, metformin has garnered significant interest due to its ability to modulate insulin sensitivity, limit inflammation through inhibition of NF-κB and activate AMPK, thereby influencing multiple metabolic pathways implicated in aging (liu2022antiagingagentssafe pages 24-26).
  </p>
  <h3>B. Senolytics and Clearance of Senescent Cells</h3>
  <p>
    The accumulation of senescent cells is a hallmark of aging that contributes to chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction (li2021agingandage‐related pages 15-16). Senolytic drugs, such as dasatinib combined with quercetin, selectively clear these cells and have shown promising results in preclinical models by reducing detrimental secretions (SASP) and improving tissue function (li2023inflammationandaging pages 19-20). Clinical studies like those summarized in NCT05500742 evaluate the effects of anti‐aging dietary supplements with senolytic properties by measuring biomarkers such as proBNPage to estimate biological aging (NCT05500742). These studies collectively underscore that the selective removal of senescent cells can restore cellular homeostasis and improve regenerative capacity in older adults (liu2022antiagingagentssafe pages 26-27).
  </p>
  <h3>C. Other Pharmacological Candidates</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to rapamycin and senolytics, other compounds have been explored for their anti-aging effects. Acarbose, an FDA-approved α-glucosidase inhibitor traditionally used in diabetes management, has shown promise in extending lifespan in mouse models and is currently being evaluated in geriatric populations through pilot studies (NCT02865499). Topically administered anti-aging agents such as novel moisturizing creams enriched with biomimetic compounds have been tested in randomized controlled trials (e.g., NCT03180645 and NCT06433323) and have demonstrated improvements in hydration, elasticity, and reduction of fine lines, suggesting that preserving skin structure may be a proxy for systemic anti-aging effects (NCT03180645, NCT06433323). Moreover, recent work on dietary supplements that combine antioxidants and nutrients (e.g., HealthSpan formulations) indicates that bolstering the endogenous antioxidant system can reduce protein oxidative damage and modulate proteolytic systems implicated in aging (NCT05202652).
  </p>

  <h2>III. Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Aging</h2>
  <h3>A. Nutrient Sensing and Metabolic Pathways</h3>
  <p>
    One of the hallmark pathways of aging is deregulated nutrient sensing, which includes the insulin/IGF-1 signaling axis, AMPK, and mTOR pathways. Caloric restriction (CR), which reduces energy intake without malnutrition, consistently improves markers of metabolic health by modulating these critical pathways (li2021agingandage‐related pages 12-15). CR has been shown to enhance mitochondrial function, promote autophagy, and reduce systemic inflammation, all of which contribute to a deceleration of the aging process (mkrtchyan2020ardd2020from pages 6-7). Importantly, trials and observational studies underscore that intermittent fasting and regulated caloric intake can lower incidences of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline (martinovic2024climbingthelongevity pages 7-8).
  </p>
  <h3>B. Telomere Maintenance and Genomic Stability</h3>
  <p>
    Telomere shortening is a well-recognized marker of cellular aging and contributes to genomic instability. Telomerase activation, either through endogenous pathways or via supplementation with natural compounds such as TA-65, has been proposed as an anti-aging intervention by maintaining telomere length and delaying the onset of cellular senescence (li2021agingandage‐related pages 12-15). However, excessive telomerase activation must be cautiously balanced against potential oncogenic risks (liu2022antiagingagentssafe pages 27-28).
  </p>
  <h3>C. Cellular Senescence and Proteostasis</h3>
  <p>
    The dysregulation of proteostasis—the balance of protein synthesis, folding, and degradation—is another contributing factor to aging. Chaperone proteins including HSP70 and regulatory molecules such as Sirtuin 1 help maintain protein homeostasis and their modulation can delay the accumulation of damaged proteins (li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 13-14). Enhancing autophagy has also been shown to remove misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, thereby promoting cellular health and longevity (liu2022antiagingagentssafe pages 5-7).
  </p>
  <h3>D. Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Immune Function</h3>
  <p>
    Oxidative stress is a central driver of aging due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. Natural antioxidants such as resveratrol, quercetin, and polyphenols provide protective effects by scavenging ROS and upregulating endogenous antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and catalase (li2018effectofresveratrol pages 1-2, li2018effectofresveratrol pages 2-4). Chronic low-grade inflammation (“inflammaging”) further exacerbates tissue damage. Anti-inflammatory strategies including the use of metformin and senolytics, as well as lifestyle modifications such as exercise, contribute to reducing systemic inflammation and enhancing immune function (li2021agingandage‐related pages 15-16, li2023inflammationandaging pages 17-18).
  </p>

  <h2>IV. Nutritional Strategies for Healthy Aging</h2>
  <h3>A. Diet Composition and Nutraceuticals</h3>
  <p>
    Nutritional factors play a pivotal role in modulating aging, as they influence inflammation, oxidative damage, and gut microbiome composition. Diets rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and unsaturated fats—exemplified by the Mediterranean dietary pattern—are associated with reduced risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders (fekete2022nutritionstrategiespromoting pages 3-5). In addition, specific nutraceuticals such as resveratrol and royal jelly have been shown to exert beneficial effects on lipid metabolism, hormone regulation, and immune modulation, all of which contribute to delaying aging (kunugi2019royaljellyand pages 23-25).
  </p>
  <h3>B. Dietary Restriction and Intermittent Fasting</h3>
  <p>
    Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting (IF) are two dietary strategies that have been directly linked with lifespan extension and improved healthspan. CR, when performed over a sustained period, not only reduces the risk of age-related cardiovascular and metabolic diseases but also promotes increased insulin sensitivity and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis (li2021agingandage‐related pages 12-15, martinovic2024climbingthelongevity pages 7-8). Similarly, IF protocols have been associated with improvements in inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid profiles, with human studies demonstrating reductions in risk for major diseases (martinovic2024climbingthelongevity pages 7-8).
  </p>
  <h3>C. Supplementation with Vitamins and Minerals</h3>
  <p>
    Adequate intake of micronutrients such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and zinc has been highlighted as essential for maintaining bodily functions that decline with age (fekete2022nutritionstrategiespromoting pages 3-5). For example, vitamin D supplementation is recommended to preserve bone health and immune function, especially in older adults, while zinc helps in maintaining immune competence and countering chronic inflammation (fekete2022nutritionstrategiespromoting pages 3-5). Hydration levels also play a critical role in preserving physiological functions and preventing age-related decline in cognitive and cardiovascular systems (fekete2022nutritionstrategiespromoting pages 3-5).
  </p>
  <h3>D. Gut Microbiome Modulation</h3>
  <p>
    The gastrointestinal microbiome is emerging as a key player in the regulation of human aging due to its effects on nutrient absorption, metabolism, and systemic inflammation. Evidence suggests that interventions aimed at restoring a healthy gut microbiota—whether through dietary intervention, probiotics, or even fecal microbiota transplantation—can promote healthy aging by enhancing immune function and reducing chronic inflammation (li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 15-16, moqri2023biomarkersofaging pages 21-23).
  </p>

  <h2>V. Lifestyle Interventions</h2>
  <h3>A. Physical Exercise and Activity</h3>
  <p>
    Regular physical exercise has been consistently linked with delayed aging, improved cardiovascular health, and enhancement of muscle strength and cognitive function. Aerobic exercise, such as walking and running, improves endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide availability and reducing arterial stiffness (li2023vascularagingassessment pages 10-12). Resistance training, particularly when combined with balance and flexibility exercises, helps to maintain muscle mass and bone density, reducing the risk of frailty and falls in the elderly (martinovic2024climbingthelongevity pages 7-8). Long-term exercise also positively modulates systemic inflammation and enhances telomerase activity in circulating white blood cells, which is associated with longevity (mkrtchyan2020ardd2020from pages 6-7, li2023inflammationandaging pages 17-18).
  </p>
  <h3>B. Stress Management and Psychological Health</h3>
  <p>
    Chronic psychological stress accelerates aging via activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the consequent release of glucocorticoids, which impair neurogenesis and promote inflammation. Maintaining psychological well‑being through mindfulness, stress reduction techniques, and social engagement can mitigate these effects (li2023inflammationandaging pages 19-20). Evidence shows that environments with lower chronic stress correlate with improved immune function and a slower rate of telomere shortening, emphasizing the role of psychosocial factors in healthy aging (moqri2023biomarkersofaging pages 21-23).
  </p>
  <h3>C. Sleep Quality</h3>
  <p>
    Adequate sleep is another important lifestyle factor that modulates molecular pathways involved in aging, including inflammation, proteostasis, and genomic stability. Improved sleep quality has been associated with increased levels of anti-aging proteins such as S-Klotho, reduced inflammation, and enhanced cognitive performance, all of which contribute to delaying the aging process (li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 15-16, li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 16-18).
  </p>

  <h2>VI. Regenerative Medicine and Cellular Therapies</h2>
  <h3>A. Stem Cell Therapy and Tissue Regeneration</h3>
  <p>
    The decline in stem cell function is one of the key contributors to the aging process. Interventions that protect or rejuvenate stem cell populations—in particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)—have shown promise in improving tissue regeneration and delaying age-related organ decline (lawrence2024cellularsenescenceand pages 12-14). Experimentally, approaches such as heterochronic parabiosis, which involves exposing older individuals to younger blood factors, have demonstrated the capacity to increase regenerative potential, suggesting that modulation of systemic factors could reset aspects of the aging phenotype (li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 15-16).
  </p>
  <h3>B. Delivery of Growth Factors and Extracellular Vesicles</h3>
  <p>
    Innovative approaches involving the delivery of growth factors and secreted extracellular vesicles from stem cells have been explored as a means to repair tissue damage and counteract the progression of aging. These interventions target not only tissue repair but also modulate inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in aging organs (liu2022antiagingagentssafe pages 17-19).
  </p>
  <h3>C. Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering</h3>
  <p>
    Advances in biomaterials—such as the development of biocompatible hydrogels and 3D scaffolds—are being used to create environments that support stem cell regeneration and tissue repair. By modulating the microenvironment, these tissue engineering strategies help sustain cell functionality and delay the onset of tissue degeneration, representing a complementary approach to pharmacological interventions (li2023vascularagingassessment pages 10-12).
  </p>

  <h2>VII. Integration of Multipronged Strategies</h2>
  <p>
    A critical takeaway from the body of research is that no single intervention is likely to provide a panacea for aging; rather, a combination of strategies that target different aging mechanisms simultaneously appears to offer the best chance for success. Integrative approaches that marry dietary modification, physical exercise, pharmacological agents, and regenerative therapies can provide synergistic effects that slow the aging process more effectively than any one intervention alone (liu2022antiagingagentssafe pages 5-7, martinovic2024climbingthelongevity pages 18-19). For instance, pairing caloric restriction or intermittent fasting with regular exercise has been shown to significantly reduce biomarkers associated with inflammation and oxidative stress while enhancing metabolic efficiency (martinovic2024climbingthelongevity pages 7-8, li2021agingandage‐related pages 12-15).
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, advances in precision medicine and biomarker development—such as epigenetic clocks and proteomic profiling—now enable the tailoring of interventions to an individual’s specific biological age, thus optimizing their potential benefits (moqri2023biomarkersofaging pages 21-23, lyu2024longevitybiotechnologybridging pages 10-11). By combining lifestyle modifications with targeted pharmacological therapy (e.g., metformin, rapamycin, and senolytics) and regenerative approaches (e.g., stem cell therapies), the prospect of delaying human aging is becoming increasingly realistic.
  </p>

  <h2>VIII. Future Directions and Research Needs</h2>
  <p>
    Despite significant progress, many challenges remain. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are essential to validate the long-term safety and efficacy of many anti-aging interventions in diverse populations (NCT04488601, NCT05500742). Moreover, the interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental factors such as nutrition, physical activity, and psychosocial stress requires further elucidation to formulate individualized anti-aging solutions (li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 15-16, moqri2023biomarkersofaging pages 21-23).
  </p>
  <p>Future research should focus on the following areas:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Refining senolytic therapies to selectively eliminate harmful senescent cells while preserving those that contribute to tissue repair (li2023inflammationandaging pages 19-20, liu2022antiagingagentssafe pages 26-27).</li>
    <li>Developing advanced delivery mechanisms for stem cell therapies and extracellular vesicles to enhance tissue regeneration safely (lawrence2024cellularsenescenceand pages 12-14).</li>
    <li>Integrating omics-based biomarkers with clinical endpoints to establish robust aging clocks that can inform personalized anti-aging regimens (moqri2023biomarkersofaging pages 21-23, lyu2024longevitybiotechnologybridging pages 10-11).</li>
    <li>Conducting long-term observational and interventional studies that correlate dietary patterns, specific nutraceutical supplementation, and physical activity with biological aging markers (fekete2022nutritionstrategiespromoting pages 3-5, martinovic2024climbingthelongevity pages 7-8).</li>
    <li>Exploring the interaction between gut microbiota and systemic aging processes, as interventions that restore a healthy microbiome may have profound effects on inflammation and metabolism (fekete2022nutritionstrategiespromoting pages 3-5, li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 15-16).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Additionally, innovative biotechnologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, are beginning to influence how we identify and target longevity biomarkers, as evidenced by emerging tools such as the immune longevity score (ILS) that evaluates immune function and may serve as a novel aging clock (lyu2024longevitybiotechnologybridging pages 10-11, martinovic2024climbingthelongevity pages 18-19).
  </p>

  <h2>IX. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Current evidence supports that delaying human aging requires a multifactorial approach that simultaneously addresses cellular and molecular hallmarks of aging, systemic inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation. Pharmacological interventions such as rapamycin, metformin, and senolytics complement nutritional and lifestyle strategies—including caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, regular exercise, and stress management—to mitigate damage and improve regenerative capacity. Advances in regenerative medicine further enhance these approaches by enabling tissue repair and rejuvenation. Ultimately, combination therapies that integrate these diverse strategies represent the most promising avenue for extending healthy lifespan and improving quality of life in aging populations (li2021agingandage‐related pages 15-16, li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 16-18, martinovic2024climbingthelongevity pages 18-19).
  </p>
  <p>
    The journey to comprehensively delay human aging is ongoing, with clinical trials (e.g., NCT02865499, NCT04488601, NCT05500742) and multidisciplinary research steadily unraveling the complex biological pathways involved. Although challenges remain, the convergence of nutritional strategies, pharmacological breakthroughs, and innovative regenerative therapies has generated feasible and safe interventions that, when applied in tandem, may slow the aging process in humans (li2018effectofresveratrol pages 1-2, li2021agingandage‐related pages 12-15, li2023inflammationandaging pages 17-18).
  </p>

  <h2>X. Summary</h2>
  <p>In summary, reasonable interventions to delay human aging include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Metabolic modulation through mTOR inhibition (e.g., rapamycin) and insulin sensitivity enhancement (e.g., metformin) to improve cellular repair and reduce inflammation. (li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 16-18)</li>

  </ul>
  <p>
    As research continues to evolve, these strategies will likely be refined and combined into comprehensive clinical protocols that target multiple aging pathways concurrently, thereby offering a robust defense against age-related decline (Clinical Trial Search: anti-aging OR longevity OR 延缓衰老 OR healthy aging OR 延迟人体衰老).
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, while human aging remains an inescapable biological process, substantial progress has been made in developing interventions that can slow its progression and improve healthspan. The key to successful anti-aging therapies lies in the integration of diverse approaches—from pharmacological targeting of metabolic and inflammatory pathways to lifestyle modifications and regenerative interventions—culminating in a personalized strategy for delaying the onset of age-related diseases and functional decline (NCT02865499, NCT03180645, NCT04488601).
  </p>
  <p>
    Future research and clinical trials will continue to build on this foundation, moving the field closer to interventions that not only extend lifespan but also enhance the quality of life during the later years. The convergence of cutting-edge biotechnology with traditional practices such as nutrition and exercise makes it increasingly feasible to design safe, effective, and individualized anti-aging regimens (li2024molecularmechanismsof pages 15-16, martinovic2024climbingthelongevity pages 23-23).
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, delaying human aging is best approached through a multipronged strategy that targets fundamental biological mechanisms, integrates advanced clinical methodologies, and emphasizes the importance of lifestyle factors, ultimately paving the way toward sustained healthy longevity (liu2022antiagingagentssafe pages 1-2, li2021agingandage‐related pages 15-16, moqri2023biomarkersofaging pages 21-23).
  </p>
  <p>
    This comprehensive review highlights that with continued research and clinical validation, an integrative approach combining pharmacological, nutritional, lifestyle, and regenerative strategies holds promise for effectively delaying human aging, thereby improving both lifespan and quality of life in an aging global population (Clinical Trial Search: anti-aging OR longevity OR 延缓衰老 OR healthy aging OR 延迟人体衰老, NCT06374069, NCT06433323).
